# CSC-4301-Project

Hello Professor,

In this project we implemented a Handwritten Digit Recognition system. It takes a handwritten number as input and outputs the number it recognized.
We were not able to make it into a handwritten mathematical symbol recognizer since it was very complicated to do in a short time period specially since we wanted to modify a Handwritten Digit Recognition system and make do the latter thing. 
Instead we made this project more efficient by changing the code and training the model. We also used some new deep learning libraries that exist in python to help us accomplish our project. 

We were not able to achieve 100% efficiency, i think due to the lack of model training ressources and some problems with the GPU drivers.
